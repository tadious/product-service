Collections and Product service API.

1. How to build and run:
npm install
npm run dev

2. Tools used: 
NodeJS    - The primary tech stack.
Express   - Web server and routing
MongoDB   - DB and storage
Mongoose  - DB Abstraction and ORM
Gulp      - Some automation

3. Why the tools above:
NodeJS together with express and mongoDB is quite simple and good for quickly creating APIs and prototyping. NoSQL DBs have the extra advantage of flexibility with design.ss

4. Not completed:
There was a misunderstanding about the tasks so I only received this task on the 30th (Wednesday). I opted to bash it out overnight so unfortunately, there are components that are not completed. They are listed below:
- Data validation for duplication on data import
- Only managed to set up the tests but did not have the time to write any good tests :/
- Also did not have the time to squash commits all and have a clean respository for version control
